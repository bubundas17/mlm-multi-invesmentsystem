          tampered with, and where appropriate SHA hashes are provided for end users to confirm they have downloaded the
          correct file. Nonetheless, AMP does not guarantee that files available for downloading through this website

        <h3 id="sponsors-and-advertisers-are-not-endorsed">Sponsors and Advertisers are Not Endorsed</h3>

          made by sponsors and advertisers. AMP does not review, endorse or recommend the products or services of any
          company mentioned on our site. We will not be liable in any way for damages of any kind resulting out of the

          our website. The information available on Third Parties' websites may have certain restrictions on its use or
          distribution which differ from these TOU.</p>

        <h3 id="password-protected-areas">Password Protected Areas</h3>

        <p>Some areas of the AMP site ("Password Protected Areas"), primarily the AMP forum, are password protected and
          available only to Users who are registered on the AMP forum. Registration requires Users to fully complete the
          account registration process. AMP reserves the right to deny or revoke registration or access to Password
          Protected Areas for any User. AMP takes reasonable measures to ensure the security of the Password Protected
          Areas but cannot guarantee the absolute security of information or communications in such Password Protected
          Areas. Users are responsible for maintaining the security of the password they set and must notify us if they
          believe that the security of their password or account has been breached or subject to unauthorized use.
          Additional account security is available through the use of GPG authentication, and all users of any Password
          Protected Areas are encouraged to take advantage of this layer of protection. AMP will not be liable for any
          loss or liability incurred as a result of an unauthorized person using a User's password.</p>

        <h3 id="exclusion-of-limitations-and-disclaimers">EXCLUSION OF LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS</h3>

        <p>BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF

          any principles of conflicts of laws. Each User hereby attorns and agrees to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of
          the courts of the Western Cape, South Africa. The failure by a User or AMP to exercise any right or to enforce
          any provision of the TOU shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the TOU
          is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the court shall give effect to
          the intentions reflected in the provision to the degree possible, and the other provisions of the TOU will
          remain in full force and effect. It is the express will of AMP and each User that the TOU and any applicable
          TOS have been prepared in English.</p>
